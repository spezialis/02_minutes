# 2 minutes
2 minutes is an Android application. It allows to the 20 minutes newspaper readers to reveal the hidden content of the covers thanks to Augmented Reality technology.

This application is thought as a kind of hack, it's way to humorously criticize the 20 minutes journal content that we often find empty, free of content, and badly written.

The application is called 2 minutes because, in one hand, it only refers to the 20 minutes newspapers, on the other hand it means that this is an experience that can be lived on weekdays and that doesn't last more than 2 minutes.

The application functions is to enhance the information delivered by the 20 minutes newspapers so it becomes interactive and digitally manipulable. Sometimes the content of the covers are replaced by popular videos. Some other times, the titles as well as the paragraph contents are changed or spoken by some strange voices. Other times all advertisements are displayed outside the newspaper.

The 20 minutes newspaper and the Augmented Reality technology offered us endless ways to create an interactive content by editing digitally the real one. This is a hack, an approach to criticize the newspapers process to create news, articles and advertising.

To create and then build the Android application we used [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com) engine. To realize the Augmented Reality content we used [Vuforia](https://vuforia.com/) platform.
